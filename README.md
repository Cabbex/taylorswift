# taylorswift
This is just a fun site I created.<br>
It's a PHP page that looks through the folder `images/` and randomly selects a image as the background.<br>
Then it does the same with `sounds/` and plays a random Taylor Swift song using the `<audio>` tag.

<hr>
I didn't add the images or the songs because of copyright reasons.<br>
If you want them then just search on the internet for some appropiate images and songs.
